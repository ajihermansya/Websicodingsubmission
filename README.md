The "Maternal and Child Monitoring Application" is specifically developed to track and monitor the health status of pregnant women and children. Its primary objective is to identify and detect the early signs of stunting, a condition characterized by impaired growth and development in children under the age of five. Stunting typically results from prolonged malnutrition during the critical period of the first 1,000 days of life, spanning from pregnancy until the child reaches two years of age. By focusing on early detection and intervention, this application aims to address the risk factors associated with stunting and promote healthier outcomes for mothers and children alike.
